Not forked because I do not want all the other themes in the repo.

My version with the following fixes:

- bootstrap-collapse.js is served locally so now the collapse button works perfectly. Related with this issue: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/issues/126
- jQuery version updated so Chrome does not complaing about unsafe scripts.
- Added support for tables of contents.
- Other minor fixes
